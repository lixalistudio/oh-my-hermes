description: Use when a user first installs Oh My Hermes or asks to set up the product-building loop for a project

## Overview

Configures the Product Loop with minimal questions. It infers project settings,
offers defaults, and leaves unavailable integrations as non-blocking follow-up
work.

## When to Use

- User says "set up the product loop", "set up the CTO loop", or "get started".
- Required agent profiles or kanban are missing.
- A project has not saved its repository and production context.

## Prerequisites

- Hermes Agent with profiles, Kanban, cron, and memory support.
- Oh My Hermes files installed.
- Optional: authenticated `gh` and a production URL.

## Procedure

1. Inspect the current git remote, package files, deployment config (wrangler.jsonc,
   `package.json`, AWS files, Shipnode config), existing Hermes memory, and
   authenticated CLI state.
2. Infer repository, production URL, deployment target (`cloudflare` default),
   backend framework, and preferred report time where possible.
3. Ask at most one message with up to three unresolved settings. Include
   recommended defaults and: "Skip any question and I will continue with the
   defaults."
4. Never ask the user to paste a token into chat. If GitHub is not authenticated,
   provide `gh auth login` as a follow-up; continue configuring local profiles.
5. Create or verify profiles: `cto`, `pm` (Product), `designer`, `dev`, `qa`,
   `security`, and `ops`.
6. Initialize Kanban and save available project context to memory, including:
   - `github-repo`, `github-username`
   - `last-deployment-url` if known
   - `deployment-target` (`cloudflare`, `aws`, `vps`)
   - `backend-framework` (`elysia`, `hono`, `nestjs`) when detectable
   - `auth-config` if Supabase or Better Auth is detected
   - `inngest-config` if `src/inngest/` exists
7. Create missing cron jobs only:
   - hourly product/backlog review when a repository exists
   - 15-minute health check when a production URL exists
   - hourly log observation when a production URL exists
   - daily status report
   - daily lightweight security check when a repository exists
   - weekly full security assessment when a repository exists
8. Confirm what works now and list missing credentials or URLs as optional next
   steps. Start from the user's product idea or current highest-priority outcome,
   not automatically from GitHub issues.
9. Run `bash ~/.hermes/scripts/setup-integrations.sh --check`. Request OpenAI only when it
   is the selected model or creative provider, Buffer at the first approved
   scheduling action, and Ark/Seedance at the first approved generated-video
   action. Never require all three during initial onboarding.

## Question Policy

- Read first, ask second.
- Maximum three questions in one message.
- Every question has a recommended default.
- Silence means continue with the defaults.
- Stop only when the requested next action itself requires credentials,
  payment, destructive access, licensing, or publication approval.

## Pitfalls

- Do not create duplicate cron jobs on repeated setup.
- Do not require GitHub or production deployment to begin product discovery.
- Do not reveal credentials in chat, logs, memory, or command output.
- Do not start multiple gateways for the same messaging account.
- Do not use sudo when a user-level install path exists.

## Verification

- Seven profiles and their role files exist.
- Kanban is accessible.
- Existing cron jobs were reused rather than duplicated.
- Available project context is saved and missing integrations are explicit.
- The user can begin with a product outcome even without GitHub or deployment.
