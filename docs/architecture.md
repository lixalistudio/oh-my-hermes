# Architecture

## Boundary

Oh My Hermes is a curated workflow layer for Hermes Agent. It distributes
skills, role definitions, workflows, templates, and setup scripts. It is not a
runtime, daemon, model router, event store, or second task database.

Hermes provides profiles, Kanban, memory, cron, tools, approvals, computer use,
and subagents. Oh My Hermes composes those primitives into a product-building
lifecycle.

## Product Lifecycle

```text
Understand -> Design -> Build -> Check -> Ship -> Learn
```

The CTO coordinates seven profiles. The default Lixali Studio stack is
Cloudflare-first, with provider-specific skills for AWS and custom VPS when a
project needs them.

| Profile | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `cto` | Lifecycle, roadmap, delegation, founder communication |
| `pm` | Product clarity, priorities, positioning, SEO, content strategy |
| `designer` | UX, visual verification, launch media |
| `dev` | Working product increments |
| `qa` | User behavior, visual/accessibility checks, PR review |
| `security` | Release risk and scheduled assessments |
| `ops` | Release, health, logs, incidents |

Computer Use is a shared guarded skill. GitHub is a delivery surface. Neither is
a separate agent or the center of the architecture.

## Default Tech Stack (Lixali Studio)

| Layer | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Web app frontend | React + Vite | Cloudflare Pages |
| Marketing/blog frontend | Astro | Cloudflare Pages |
| Backend | Elysia (default) / Hono / NestJS | Cloudflare Workers for light backends and MVPs |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle | Supabase PostgreSQL when needed |
| Object storage | Cloudflare R2 | S3-compatible |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Better Auth for B2B, API keys, multi-provider |
| Background workflows | Inngest | Async jobs, scheduled functions, webhooks |
| Error tracking | Sentry | Toucan on Workers or SDK on Vite/Astro |
| Log aggregation | Axiom | Structured logs from Workers, Pages, and VPS |
| Uptime / alerting | Better Stack | Heartbeat + incident escalation |

## Deployment Targets

The default target is Cloudflare. Each target has a dedicated skill; the agent
chooses the one matching the project configuration and environment variables:

- **Cloudflare:** `deploy-to-cloudflare` — Pages for frontends, Workers for
  backends. Uses Wrangler and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- **AWS:** `deploy-to-aws` — Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, or ECS depending on
  `AWS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` and project shape.
- **Custom VPS:** `deploy-to-vps` — Node.js service deployed via
  [Shipnode](https://github.com/devalade/shipnode).

Hermes memory key `deployment-target` records the active target per project.

## State

Hermes Kanban remains the task source of truth using Triage, Todo, Ready,
Running, Blocked, and Done. Lifecycle stage, dependencies, acceptance criteria,
and completion evidence live in task bodies and metadata.

Project-local artifacts stay intentionally small:

- `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`: outcome, scope, criteria, assumptions
- `DESIGN.md`: flow, states, responsive/accessibility behavior
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md`: only when engineering handoff needs more detail
- `.agents/product-marketing-context.md`: audience, positioning, voice, evidence
- `music-license.json`: only when third-party music is used

## Approval Boundary

Agents continue through reversible work with documented defaults. Founder
approval is required for production release/rollback, public publication,
licensed media selection, payment, credentials, destructive actions, and
materially different irreversible product directions.

Hermes smart approvals are the recommended host default. Approval checks may be
disabled only when a disposable or appropriately isolated environment is the
safety boundary.

## Execution

- Hermes handles orchestration, product/design work, routine edits, tools, ops,
  and memory.
- Codex handles targeted code changes.
- Claude Code handles broad or architecturally complex implementation.
- HyperFrames handles requested deterministic launch video.
- Browser tools precede CUA; CUA is reserved for native/authenticated GUI work.

## Reliability

Completion requires evidence tied to acceptance criteria. Security and Reviewer
independently check relevant changes. Ops pairs active health checks with
deduplicated log observation. Two materially similar failed attempts block the
task and request a decision instead of continuing busywork.

| Key | Written by | Read by | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `github-repo` | `setup-cto.sh`, `onboarding` | `auto-issue-triage`, `security-review`, `create-github-pr` | `owner/repo` string | GitHub repository under management |

| `triage-last-run` | `auto-issue-triage` | `auto-issue-triage` | ISO 8601 timestamp | Guards against over-frequent triage runs (cost control) |
|| `last-deployment-url` | `deploy-to-vercel` | `rollback`, `post-deploy-followup`, `health-check` | URL string | Most recent Vercel deployment URL |
| `notification-log` | `send-notification` | CTO Agent (reporting) | Array of `{ event, timestamp, backend, delivered }` | Audit log of notifications sent |
| `rollback-log` | `rollback` | CTO Agent (reporting) | Array of `{ rolledBackAt, fromUrl, reason, healthStatus }` | Audit log of production rollbacks |

## Principles

- Product outcome over PR throughput
- Read before asking; defaults over blocked interviews
- One owner per concern; capabilities do not become agents
- Real product evidence over synthetic presentation
- Reversible autonomy with explicit irreversible gates
- Existing Hermes primitives over custom runtime machinery
